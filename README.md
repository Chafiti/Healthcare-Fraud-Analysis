# Healthcare-Fraud-Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to provide key insights into the behavior of healthcare providers who were detected to have potentially committed fraud. This project looks at inpatient healthcare claims from 2008 to 2009 and examines habits that providers suspected of fraud had when compared to their contemporaries. In this project, I organized and cleaned the data through MySQL as well as performed various join table queries to procure valuable insights. I then visualized patterns found among providers using Tableau which can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chase.calero/viz/Insurance_fraud/Dashboard1?publish=yes).

## About the Dataset
The dataset was acquired from Kaggle and is composed of information pertaining to the patient and claim which includes ID, admission and discharge date, present physicians, insurance claim amount, and diagnosis codes. The data is fictional and meant to simulate real healthcare claims while joining with a separate table containing the provider ID and whether they were involved in fraud. 

## Conclusion of Project
Upon finishing the project, here were some of my most substantial findings:

1. Suspected fraud providers billed insurance companies more on average.
2. Partial physeal arrest of right distal tibia diagnoses accounted for the most fraud claims.
3. Physicians involved in suspected fraud were nearly always the ones who took the most patients on as well.
4. The chances of fraud increased dramatically the longer a patient was admitted.
